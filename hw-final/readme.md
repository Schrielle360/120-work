# Schrielle Standish



### Final Project Proposal :

1. #### Actual proposal

  I propose to make a simple game of 'remove the Chibi' where the Chibi,
  when clicked, ends up disappearing.



2. #### inspiration


- The jumping dinosaur that happens when your chrome won't
  connect to the internet. Its an easy fun game.



3. #### Problems you may come across? new challanges?

-  I am bad with doing the numbers bit so making the score board count up each
    time a Chibi pops.
- Adding in an image to the game to make the chibi.

4. #### Work Plan

- create the Chibi
- Make the Chibi move
- make the Chibi aware of other Chibi's
- Make the Chibi disappear when popped.
- Make more Chibis appear at random
- create a score board
- finish all this by the end of finals week 8 am on the 14th.
