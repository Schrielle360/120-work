# Schrielle Standish



### Final Project Proposal :

1. #### Actual proposal

  I propose to make a simple game of 'remove the snorlax' where the snorlax, when clicked, ends up disappearing. However, if it touches another snorlax it costs you points. This would mean that your snorlax's when popped would gain you points. The objective is to keep the score about -10. If the score hits -10 then you lose and have to restart.



2. #### insperataion


- Honestly? The stupid jumping dinosaur that happens when your chrome wont connect to the internet. Its an easy fun game.



3. #### Problems you may come across? new challanges?


I am bad with doing the numbers bit so making the score board count up each time a snorlax pops.

4. #### Work Plan

- create the snorlax
- Make the snorlax move
- make the snorlax aware of other snorlax's
- Make the snorlax disappear when popped.
- Make more snorlaxs appear at random
- create a score board
- set the score board to end the game if -10
- finish all this by the end of finals week 8 am on the 14th.

## Work done so far
research, come up with ideas, cry at the concept of making the score board, and motivate self. :D 11/28/2018
