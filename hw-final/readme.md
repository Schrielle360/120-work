# Schrielle Standish



### Final Project Proposal :

1. #### Actual proposal

  I propose to make a simple game of 'remove the Chibi' where the Chibi,
  when clicked, ends up disappearing. However, if it touches another Chibi
  it costs you points. This would mean that your Chibi's when popped would
   gain you points. The objective is to keep the score about -10. If the score
    hits -10 then you lose and have to restart.



2. #### insperataion


- The jumping dinosaur that happens when your chrome won't
  connect to the internet. Its an easy fun game.



3. #### Problems you may come across? new challanges?

-  I am bad with doing the numbers bit so making the score board count up each
    time a Chibi pops.
- Adding in an image to the game to make the chibi.

4. #### Work Plan

- create the Chibi
- Make the Chibi move
- make the Chibi aware of other Chibi's
- Make the Chibi disappear when popped.
- Make more Chibis appear at random
- create a score board
- set the score board to end the game if -10
- finish all this by the end of finals week 8 am on the 14th.
