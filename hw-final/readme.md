# Schrielle Standish



### Final Project Proposal :

1. #### Actual proposal

  I propose to make a simple bubble popping game that combines the two codes from the bubbles we did in week eleven, and the bouncing balls that bounce off eachother as the example in week twelve. This would then make the balls bounce off each other, and disappear when you click them. And a score board that keeps track of how many bubbles you pop.



2. #### insperataion


- Honestly? The stupid jumping dinosaur that happens when your chrome wont connect to the internet. Its an easy fun game.



3. #### Problems you may come across? new challanges?


I am bad with doing the numbers bit so making the score board count up each time a bubble pops.

4. #### Work Plan

Finish it by Monday of finals week.
