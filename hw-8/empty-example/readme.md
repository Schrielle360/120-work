### Homework:

1. #### Summarize the work you did this homework cycle. Paying particular attention to the individual choices you made.

## ` Summary`

we talked about loops!


2. #### What steps did you take to complete the assignment?

## ` Steps Taken`

- I read all the stuff and looked at all the examples
- I familiarized myself with loops
- I practiced making multiple loops with changing
- I decided to use the idea of changing the loops when the mouse clicked
- I used the example code of changing loops to base my code off of.
- I made arcs, ellipse and other shapes
- I decided to make a cat. To make the cat I started with a base ellipse
- I then added two triangle ears.
- Then I added two ellipse eyes
- Then I added a triangle nose
- I played around a bit with color

#### Did you have any problems or issues? How did you solve these? Did you post about these to the class repo issue tracker? Did you receive any useful feedback from your classmates?

## `Problems or Issues`

This one was easy. I just followed the examples and made a basic set of loops

3. #### Is there anything in particular you learned that you would like to discuss further?

## `Particular interest in learning more`

I liked the rotating arcs. I was not fully good at it and would love to learn more about that code.

4. #### What issues did you help your fellow classmates out with this past homework cycle?


## `Help`
```
This week no one really asked for help on anything that wasn't easy to figure out.
