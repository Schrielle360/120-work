["Hello World!" Sketch](file:///C:/Users/miko/Documents/GitHub/School/120-work/hw-3/01_hello-world/index.html)

### Homework:

1. #### Summarize the work you did this homework cycle. Paying particular attention to the individual choices you made.

## ` Summary`

 This homework I did a mix of practicing making circles, reading articles and doing other such things as well as learning how to make a background and create texts with functions. With the homework part 1 I made my background purple and only made the size 600, 600 of the background.


2. #### What steps did you take to complete the assignment?

## ` Steps Taken`

- I just did what was asked of me.
- I played around with the circle making and the background making functions.
- I played with the systems on the website for the class.
- I got really mad when the browser would not load my document no matter what.
-  I am still really angry about that.
- After arguing with it for an hour and a half I just went to the forums to get things sorted out.

#### Did you have any problems or issues? How did you solve these? Did you post about these to the class repo issue tracker? Did you receive any useful feedback from your classmates?

## `Problems or Issues`

Yes I had problems and issues. I had issues with getting my index.html to load propperly and I looked at the forum because I noticed other people having the same problems.


3. #### Is there anything in particular you learned that you would like to discuss further?

## `Particular interest in learning more`

I was rather content with what we did learn. Its all so very broad that its a bit hard at times to fully grasp. Really takes some sit down to do.

4. #### What issues did you help your fellow classmates out with this past homework cycle?


## `Help`
```
I was actually so lost this time that I did not end up helping anyone else. I needed too much help to be of help.
