Summarize the work you did this homework
 cycle. Paying particular attention to the individual choices you made.

 This homework I did a mix of practicing making circles, reading articles and doing other such things as well as learning how to make a background and create texts with functions. With the homework part 1 I made my background purple and only made the size 600, 600 of the background.
What steps did you take to complete the assignment?

I just did what was asked of me. I got really mad when the browser would not load my document no matter what. I am still really angry about that. I did everything the exact way I was told and I still cant get it to work .

Did you have any problems or issues? How did you solve these? Did you post about these to the class repo issue tracker? Did you receive any useful feedback from your classmates?

Yes I had problems and issues and I looked at the forum because I noticed other people having the same problems.
