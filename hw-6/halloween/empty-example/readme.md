# Schrielle Standish



### Homework:

1. #### Summarize the work you did this homework cycle. Paying particular attention to the individual choices you made.

## ` Summary`

This homework cycle we worked on Math, Variables, and my personal favorite; movement. we mostly just talked about math (the thing I hate the most!)

2. #### What steps did you take to complete the assignment?

## ` Steps Taken`

- I did a code on my own that said 'happy halloween' with a moving pumpkin
- I looked at the example and tried to tweek it for three hours, making my own.
- I got angry because it was not working.
- I combined the code I made with the example code and CHANGED the example code
- I merged the codes till they were both functioning in tandum on the same screen.
- I tweeked my moving pumpkin to moving faster across the screen and laughed at how angry it looks.
-
#### Did you have any problems or issues? How did you solve these? Did you post about these to the class repo issue tracker? Did you receive any useful feedback from your classmates?

## `Problems or Issues`

I had a lot of issues getting used to the math, figuring out how to use a varobj and all that. I really enjoyed using the things once together though. The one thing I'm still having issues with was the reasoning behind using a couple of things but a abit more practice and I'll get it. I also had a hard time meshing code. That was FUN. (not).

3. #### Is there anything in particular you learned that you would like to discuss further?

## `Particular interest in learning more`

I need to get better at merging random things with color and all that. I am good at doing movement finally, after THREE HOURS of working on it today plus however many the last few weeks. GOT IT FIGURED OUT FINALLY. -cries-

4. #### What issues did you help your fellow classmates out with this past homework cycle?


## `Help`
```
I did not help anyone this week. I was too busy playing around, trying to figure out code,
 and reading a coding book for p5.js that was recommended with the course.
