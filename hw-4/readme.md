### Homework:

1. #### Summarize the work you did this homework cycle. Paying particular attention to the individual choices you made.

## ` Summary`

 This homework cycle we did a 'self porturate' or in my case, a pumpkin monster. I decided since it was halloween I was going to make a pumpkin Monster. I will admit I was a bit lost on trying to format the stupid thing correctly so I stole the arms and general head paramaters from the examples. I changed the examples to fit what I wanted but the examples gave me a huge help to jump start my monster.


2. #### What steps did you take to complete the assignment?

## ` Steps Taken`

- I copied the first example code into atom
- I changed the colors and saw how things were transformed to edit them later
- I remade the arms and changed the colors, making one hand have two circles and the other larger and white (Was trying to make a trick or treating back)
- I changed the chest shape to fit something else and added 'candy corn' onto it.
- I also made candy corn legs based on the triangles I had created and using the transform tool.
- I spent time working and removing and editing the head.
- The mouth was a pain to make just trying to figure out where to place the circles.

#### Did you have any problems or issues? How did you solve these? Did you post about these to the class repo issue tracker? Did you receive any useful feedback from your classmates?

## `Problems or Issues`

Surprisingly no. The content this time was pretty straight forward. I had no errors in the coding I was doing. My issue was stuck where I was dealing with making the stupid mouth. Trying to position the transformations right was a pain but it wasn't really a problem. just pain staking.

3. #### Is there anything in particular you learned that you would like to discuss further?

## `Particular interest in learning more`

rotations and transformations are fun. would definitely like more practice.

4. #### What issues did you help your fellow classmates out with this past homework cycle?

I was so busy this week I did not even check the forums.
