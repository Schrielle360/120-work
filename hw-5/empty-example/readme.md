# Schrielle Standish



### Homework:

1. #### Summarize the work you did this homework cycle. Paying particular attention to the individual choices you made.

## ` Summary`

This homework cycle we worked on Math, Variables, and my personal favorite; movement. We also talked about structuring our coding to make sure it is readable. I enjoyed all of this.


2. #### What steps did you take to complete the assignment?

## ` Steps Taken`

- I read through all of the readings for this week and watched the videos
- I familiarized myself with code movement on screen
- I got more used to using the 'pi' function and understanding the 'let' function
- I then proceeded to do the homework.
- I used the example as a basic model for what I should do, then played with it till my character had glasses.
- I decided I did not want a head but the head served as a base so I removed it by creating an unseeable triangle
- I changed the shape of the mouth because I'm still bad at doing arcs. But continued to use it.
- I worked on using the legs the same way, changing the colors and such to match what I wanted.
- I familiarized myself with how the code was set up so I could better play with it later.
- I tried three different sets of 'creatures' that spun and such before I was happy.

#### Did you have any problems or issues? How did you solve these? Did you post about these to the class repo issue tracker? Did you receive any useful feedback from your classmates?

## `Problems or Issues`

I had to arge with the let function for a while. I really hated that till I got the hang of just assigning numbers sand such and then using it later in other coding. For some reason that was not sticking in my dang head.

3. #### Is there anything in particular you learned that you would like to discuss further?

## `Particular interest in learning more`

I want to spend more time on learning about placement of code. Like where we sit things you know? How does changing the transition make things rotate on the canvas and such. I'm really bad at mapping that out on my own and it hurts my head thinking about it.

4. #### What issues did you help your fellow classmates out with this past homework cycle?


## `Help`
```
I did not help anyone this week. One week I had an issue and got made fun of by a guy who said it was easy so I was kinda mad and have not gone to the forum since.
